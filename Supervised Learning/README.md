## Description

      * Research Question
 
 * Create a prediction model that more accurately predicts whether a user will click an Ad.

        * Context
        
* A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog.
* She currently targets audiences originating from various countries.
* In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.
* She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to create a solution that would allow her to determine whether ads targeted to audiences of certain characteristics i.e. city, male country, ad topic, etc. would click on her ads.

## Experimental Design
