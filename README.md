## Description

      * Research Question

 * Learn the characteristics of customer groups using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques.

        * Context

* Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. 
* The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year.
* More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.


## Experimental Design

1. Problem Definition
2. Data Sourcing
3. Check the Data
4. Perform Data Cleaning
5. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
6. Implement the Solution: 
    * K-Means Clustering, 
    * Hierachical Clustering,
    * PCA-Principal Component Analysis
    * t-SNE; t Distributed Stochastic Neighbours Embedding
7. Challenge the Solution
8. Follow up Questions
